The Car Price Prediction project is a machine learning initiative focused on estimating the prices of used cars based on key attributes like model year, number of previous owners, transmission type, fuel type, current price, kilometers driven, etc. Using historical data from open-source datasets, this project applies Random forest algorithm and performed hyperparameter tuning  to build a predictive model with high accuracy. The model is intended to help users make better decisions when buying or selling used vehicles by providing reliable price estimates. It undergoes preprocessing steps to handle missing values and encode categorical variables, which improve model performance.
Evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared scores are used to select the best-performing model.
